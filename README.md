# pixi-plain-js

Project setup to hack on [pixijs](https://www.pixijs.com/) apps using plain JavaScript
with as little transpilation as possible.

## Installation

Clone this repo + run `npm install`.

## Usage

Run `npm start` to start watching and serving your game page.

Run `npm run build` to create a distributable version of your game inside `./dist`.

## Setup

[parceljs](https://parceljs.org/) is used to bundle and serve JavaScript.

As transpilation cannot be turned off entirely at this point the below setting in
`package.json` keeps transpilation to a mimimum during development.

```js
"browserslist": {
  "development": [
    "last 1 chrome version"
  ]
}
```

[hot module replacement](https://parceljs.org/hmr.html) is also enabled (see `./main.js`).

Basically the game is recreated with a new Canvas after the old Canvas was removed from the
page. This means that when serving your game via `npm start` you can simply make edits and save
and see the browser page update itself.
